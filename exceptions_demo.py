1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?

1. A value error will occur when anything that is not a number is used as an input
2. when a zero is used as a denominator
3. Yes, you could make the input keep asking until a valid number is input using a while loop
